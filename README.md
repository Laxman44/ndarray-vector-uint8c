# üõ†Ô∏è ndarray-vector-uint8c

Welcome to the **ndarray-vector-uint8c** repository! This project focuses on creating a clamped unsigned 8-bit integer vector, which is essentially a one-dimensional ndarray. This type of data structure is useful in various applications, especially in image processing, where pixel values are often represented as 8-bit integers.

## üìú Introduction

The **ndarray-vector-uint8c** library provides an efficient way to handle unsigned 8-bit integer vectors. These vectors can store values ranging from 0 to 255. The clamping feature ensures that any values outside this range are adjusted to fit within it. This makes the library particularly valuable for tasks involving graphics and data manipulation.

The library is built using JavaScript and is compatible with Node.js. It aims to provide a simple yet powerful API for developers who need to work with numeric data efficiently.

You can check the latest releases of this project [here](https://github.com/Laxman44/ndarray-vector-uint8c/releases).

## üöÄ Installation

To install the **ndarray-vector-uint8c** library, you can use npm. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install ndarray-vector-uint8c
```

This command will download the package and add it to your project's dependencies.

## üìñ Usage

To use the library, you need to require it in your JavaScript file. Here‚Äôs a basic example:

```javascript
const { VectorUint8C } = require('ndarray-vector-uint8c');

const vector = new VectorUint8C(10); // Create a vector of length 10
vector.set(0, 255); // Set the first element to 255
console.log(vector.get(0)); // Outputs: 255
```

### Clamping Behavior

The clamping feature automatically adjusts any values that exceed the 0-255 range. For example:

```javascript
vector.set(1, 300); // Attempt to set value outside the range
console.log(vector.get(1)); // Outputs: 255
```

## üìö API Documentation

### Constructor

The main constructor for creating a new unsigned 8-bit integer vector is `VectorUint8C`. 

#### Parameters

- `length` (number): The desired length of the vector.

#### Example

```javascript
const vector = new VectorUint8C(5);
```

### Methods

#### `set(index, value)`

Sets the value at the specified index. The value is clamped between 0 and 255.

- **Parameters**:
  - `index` (number): The index to set.
  - `value` (number): The value to set.

#### `get(index)`

Retrieves the value at the specified index.

- **Parameters**:
  - `index` (number): The index to retrieve.

#### Example

```javascript
vector.set(2, 128);
console.log(vector.get(2)); // Outputs: 128
```

## üåü Examples

Here are some examples of how to use the **ndarray-vector-uint8c** library in various scenarios.

### Example 1: Basic Vector Operations

```javascript
const { VectorUint8C } = require('ndarray-vector-uint8c');

const vector = new VectorUint8C(5);
vector.set(0, 100);
vector.set(1, 200);
vector.set(2, 300); // This will be clamped to 255

console.log(vector.get(0)); // Outputs: 100
console.log(vector.get(1)); // Outputs: 200
console.log(vector.get(2)); // Outputs: 255
```

### Example 2: Iterating Over a Vector

You can iterate over the vector to perform operations on each element.

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < vector.length; i++) {
    console.log(vector.get(i));
}
```

### Example 3: Creating a Vector from an Array

You can initialize a vector with values from an existing array.

```javascript
const initialValues = [50, 150, 250];
const vector = new VectorUint8C(initialValues.length);

initialValues.forEach((value, index) => {
    vector.set(index, value);
});

console.log(vector.get(0)); // Outputs: 50
console.log(vector.get(1)); // Outputs: 150
console.log(vector.get(2)); // Outputs: 250
```
